# MLSA-BOOTCAMP-TEAM2
This is a capstone project for Team2 on the Microsoft Student Learn Ambassador Mixed Reality Bootcamp, 2021. This Project focuses on teaching secondary school students on the basic parts of the human brain while also enabling them to practically visualize and interact with every parts of the brain as though they were real. This would literally give them an edge over the traditional classroom learning where they are made to learn those things from drawings/images in a textbook.
